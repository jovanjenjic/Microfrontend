# mfe - MICROFRONTEND 
 
Microfrontend applications with one base aplication (container) and several external applications (Marketing - react, Auth - react and Dashboard - vue).

To start applications you need to start each application as separete with command: npm start (you have to do npm ci if needed);

There are workflows files into .github folder. We use this file to set up CI/CD pipline for production mode.
